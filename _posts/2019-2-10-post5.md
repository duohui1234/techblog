## HTTP Connection

- HTTP connection is a protocol that runs on a socket.

- HTTP connection is a higher-level abstraction of a network connection.
- With HTTP connection the implementation takes care of all these higher-level details and simply send HTTP request (some header information) and receive HTTP response from the server.

## Socket Connection

- Socket is used to transport data between systems. It simply connects two systems together, an IP address is the address of the machine over an IP based network.
- With socket connection you can design your own protocol for network connection between two systems.
- With Socket connection you need to take care of all the lower-level details of a TCP/IP connection.
